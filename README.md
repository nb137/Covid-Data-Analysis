# Covid Data Analysis
 

A simple dump of my code to track covid cases with graphs

See my notebook on [tracking new cases](Covid_Data_Plots.ipynb)

Or my notebook on [tracking vaccines administered](Covid_Vaccine_Progress.ipynb)

Note that notebooks don't update on github, so they will only show the latest data if run, or after I have pushed new versions to the repo. The dates of latest update and data are embedded in the workbook.

A version of the python code I've used is also kept here for reference, but I've removed explicit file locations for privacy as well as my "covid_support" file.

The "covid_support" file calls github desktop to ensure that data is pulled from the [Johns Hopkins data source](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/) on github into a local directory, and then compiles the multiple files from that into one dataframe of covid statistics.

If you're looking at this to judge my work in python: I much prefer working with .py files in an IDE (Spyder) than using a notebook, but the notebooks are a nice way to present a project on github.
